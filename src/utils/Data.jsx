    li1: "What is Voice Commerce Ever wondered about getting instant answers in the form of ‚Äúspeech‚Äù rather than typing? Well, it is no longer a mystery, rather a reality nowadays . Voice Commerce refers to the use of voice based solutions to search and purchase products from an e-commerce platform. This is like talking to the website. Customer needs to voice out which product or service he is looking for, the platform will seamlessly execute this command through ‚ÄòArtificial Intelligence‚Äô and ‚ÄòNatural Language Processing‚Äô technology.",
    li2: "Voice commerce is indeed a new age of e-commerce. Conversational AI simplifies any task for the e-commerce customers. Online retailers can now allow their customers to look for items, place the order, make payment as per preference, track the order status and provide post delivery feedback. Furthermore, these command histories can be used to make future orders.",
    li3: "How Voice Commerce helps E-Commerce Brands: One of the biggest challenges in e-commerce is that the potential customers are dropping off before executing a purchase. The most common reasons are either because the customers are unable to decide which products to buy or simply they fail to execute the research. This is exactly where voice commerce comes to play. There are so many alternatives in the market nowadays that almost everyone seems to be in a quandary to select which one to purchase. With Voice Commerce, people can just utter the product they are looking for; for example ‚Äúwhat are the best mobile covers under 500 bdt‚Äù. The intelligent voice assistant will instantly scan all relevant data  to find you the best possible cover and alternatives. This not only smoothens the user experience, but also streamlines the operation for the e-commerce as they no longer are required to invest extra resources in this. Basically, voice commerce is the language of the customer's choice. ",
    li4: "Trends & Use Cases of Voice Commerce: Voice Commerce is indeed a game changer for the industry. Researchers predict that by 2022, voice based shopping will penetrate about 55% of all American households, hitting about 40 billion dollars by that time. This platform will be a pivotal part of the user experience strategy. Following are the list of trends and uses of voice commerce- ",
    li5: "01. Personalized shopping experience: voice commerce will personalize the shopping experiences with the use of recommendations based on individual preferences. Suppose, a customer is exploring Daraz to buy electronic appliances for households. The voice assistant in the platform can better suggest the trending electronics that are hitting the market. It will help the customer with better informed decision making and enable repetitive buying.",
    li6: "02. Suggest better reviews: Another major advantage of using voice commerce is that it has the power to suggest better customer recommendations and reviews. The ease and convenience of reviewing products make them more meaningful and genuine. Voice assistants certainly reduce the task of typing long feedbacks.
